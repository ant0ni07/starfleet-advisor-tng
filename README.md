# Starfleet Advisor (TNG Edition) üöÄ

A **multi-agent conversational AI application** that provides Starfleet-themed advice from the crew of the USS Enterprise-D. Users can ask questions on various topics, and the system intelligently routes their query to the most appropriate TNG officer (Captain Picard, Commander Data, Counselor Troi, Commander Riker, or Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge) for a personalized response. The app also includes conversational memory and a custom farewell system.

### Features ‚ú®

* **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Leverages LangGraph to orchestrate specialized AI agents:
    * **Linguistic Analyst:** Processes user input into formal "Computer Log" entries.
    * **Tactical Officer (Classifier):** Dynamically selects the best TNG character to respond based on the query's nature (e.g., ethical, technical, emotional).
    * **Starfleet Advisors:** Five distinct TNG personas (Picard, Data, Troi, Riker, Geordi) provide tailored advice.
* **Conversational Memory:** Characters remember previous turns in the conversation for a more coherent dialogue.
* **Thematic Farewell:** Detects "goodbye" intent and responds with a Star Trek-themed closing message.
* **Streamlit UI:** Interactive and user-friendly web interface.
* **Powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash:** Utilizes a powerful, fast, and cost-effective LLM.

### How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The application uses a **LangGraph state machine** to manage the flow of information and agent interactions:

1.  **User Query:** The user submits a question via the Streamlit interface.
2.  **Linguistic Analyst:** The query is first converted into a formal `Computer Log` entry by a dedicated LLM agent. This log is displayed to the user for thematic effect.
3.  **Farewell Detection:** A separate LLM agent analyzes the *original user query* to determine if it's a conversational farewell.
    * If **Yes**: The system directly generates a generic Star Trek farewell message and concludes the conversation flow.
    * If **No**: The flow continues to character selection.
4.  **Character Selection:** An **LLM-powered "Tactical Officer" agent** analyzes the `Computer Log` to identify the core intent (e.g., engineering, ethical, psychological) and intelligently routes the query to the most suitable TNG character.
5.  **Character Response:** The chosen TNG character (e.g., Picard, Data) receives the *original user query* (along with the full chat history for context) and generates a personalized response in their distinct persona, directly addressing the user.
6.  **Display:** The character's response is presented in the Streamlit chat interface.

### Setup and Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/starfleet-advisor-tng.git](https://github.com/your-username/starfleet-advisor-tng.git)
    cd starfleet-advisor-tng
    ```
2.  **Create a Python virtual environment** (recommended for managing dependencies):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    First, ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file generated by running this command in your project root:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Then, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your Google API Key:**
    * Obtain a Google API Key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * Create a file named `.env` in the **root** of your project directory.
    * Add your API key to this file:
        ```dotenv
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * **Important:** Keep your `.env` file private and do **NOT** commit it to GitHub. It's excluded by the `.gitignore` file.

5.  **(Optional) For LangSmith Tracing:** If you want to debug and visualize the agent's thought process (highly recommended for development and monitoring):
    * Create an account on [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).
    * Get your LangSmith API Key from your account settings.
    * Add these to your `.env` file as well:
        ```dotenv
        LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
        LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY"
        LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="starfleet-advisor-tng"
        ```
